Week 2
I established our team and after talking with members, our project was confirmed :chat bot. My task was the realisation of basic chatting of our chatbot. 
I looked for paper and tutorials online and planned to try seq2seq and later I downloaded all available software tools and libraries.

Week3
I designed the whole process of chatbot. I also finished the flow charts and schedule of the proposal, and undertook the final check of our proposal.

Week4
I collected the dataset required in our project from open source and preprocess the data using excel and python, in which I split the data into problem sets and answer sets and cleaned the data.

Week5
I wrote the first version of seq2seq and finished train_bot.py and chat.py. At this time, my model can respond some casual questions.

Week6
I have trained my chatbot several times and some problems occurred, such as irrelevant replies. I summarised problems and searched them online and found a new training set to train my chatbot.

Week7
I changed the structure of the Seq2seq chatbot and now it could handle basic conversation.

Week8
I explain at detail as possible in the report; Also, I write down all the reference that I have used.

Week9
Combing seq2seq chatbot with all the other function, writing router.py which could communicate with the website backend.

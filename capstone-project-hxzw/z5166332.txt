 Week1
I basically knew the tasks of projects after the lecture. Looked for a team on the forum.

Week 2
I joined a team and after meeting our project's topic was decided. I was assigned to design additional functions and undertook the back end.

Week 3
Met with members and determined the initial epics of our project. As for each epic, I found and researched some paper and then wrote epics of our proposal.

Week4
I turned to seq2seq model to deal with the conversion of voice input into text. On my team members advice, I also tried to use HMM model to recognise voice input.

Week5
2 models done last week don't give a good performance in the recognition of speech, I turned to google to find another way to address the problem. And retried a third-party library.

Week6
I have fixed bugs of toxic filter function's answers. I used django to realise the spelling correction


week7
I have designed username and password database, and finished parts of database for forum.

Week8
Voice input and output have been finished after debug and I encapsulate it and the spelling correction to make them easy to call.

Week9
After meeting, we have known following jobs everyone should undertake. I am assigned to take charge the final report. I experience our product and give the feedback to Yue and after talking with others we adjust functions.

Week10
I write the function description, conclusion of the final report and design the flowcharts in our report

Week11
I write the user documentation and adjust the format of our report.
